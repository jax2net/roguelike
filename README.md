# roguelike
My attempt at making a roguelike, dungeon-crawler-esque game using minimal libraries. No graphics libraries, and using only SDL to handle input and basic rendering. Project is for learning purposes only, and by no means is it professionally made. I'm just documenting its progress here on Github.
## Dependencies
gcc and SDL2
